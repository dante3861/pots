    "This step varies depending on the type of pot. So far, we've created algorithms to remove handles from Amphoras, Bell-Kraters and Column-Kraters. Some pots have similar style of handles so the same algorithm could potentially be used for multiple classes (e.g. bell-kraters and Hydrias both have handles that stick out, in a northward direction, that don't re-connect to the pot. Thus we can possibly use the same handle-removal-algorithm for both of these clases)."
